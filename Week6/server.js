// https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars is a Handlebars view engine for Express which provides a way to render dynamic HTML pages using Handlebars templates. It allows you to separate your HTML structure from your application logic, making it easier to manage and maintain your views. With express-handlebars, you can create reusable templates, partials, and layouts, which can help you build more complex and dynamic web applications efficiently.
